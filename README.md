# sketch-book

A web tool to scribble around. One can also collaborate with other users on sketches.

## Guidelines

### Backend (Express)

- Install the dependencies
  ```
  npm i
  ```
- To run the backend
  ```
  npm run server
  ```

### Frontend (React)

- Install the dependencies
  ```
  cd frontend && npm i
  ```
- To run the frontend
  ```
  npm run start
  ```

## About the project

- The tech stack that I used: **MERN**.

- Both the frontend and backend exist in the same repository. A separate directory _frontend_ has been desginated for the frontend.

- For backend, I took help of libraries such as `mongoose`, `body-parser`, `nodemon`, `cors` and `dotenv-flow`.

- For frontend, libraries used are `axios`, `material-ui` and `react-hot-toast`.

## Features to be added

- Authentication using JWT

..\* As of now, the authentication is simple (required fields, email validation, password length).

- Authentication with Google (using Firebase).

- Redo/Undo/Clear in Sketch

..\* As of now, the user can only add the scribbles on the sketch (just like scribbling a pen on a white sheet).

..\* Need to add options like: Redo/Undo/Clear.

- Real-time collaboration with other contributors to a sketch (just like Google Docs/Sheets).

- Forgot Password.

## End note

At last, I would like to thank [Vivek H V](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-h-v/) for giving me the opportunity to create such a project. This project was built as a screening assignment.

I really enjoyed the process. I even got frustated sometimes :sweat_smile: when things didn't worked out. But, that's the way to learn.
